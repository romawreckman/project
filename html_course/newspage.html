            It was a day of change. After the long Russian winter, spring had come to the north Caucasus. The air was warmer. Passing trucks and boots kicked up dust from the ruins of Grozny. The city centre was now bombed-out buildings and piles of bricks as far as you could see.

            It was Sunday March 26 2000. Far to the north, in Moscow, Vladimir Putin was waiting to see if voting in Russia’s presidential election would confirm him in the post he had held in an acting capacity since the retirement of his predecessor Boris Yeltsin at the turn of the year. It did.

        <h2 class="news-post-title">Elon Musk vows to move Tesla factory in lockdown row</h2>

            Billionaire Tesla boss Elon Musk has said he will move the electric carmaker's headquarters out of California, after he was ordered to keep its only US vehicle plant closed.

            "Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately," the CEO tweeted.
            
            The company was filing a lawsuit against Alameda County, he added.
            
            The county's health department had refused to let the Tesla factory reopen on Friday, citing lockdown measures.

        <h2 class="news-post-title">Have a question about the 2020 election? Siri can now answer it for you</h2>
        <a href="#" class="news-post-img">

            As reported by TechCrunch, you can ask Siri for information about real-time results. For instance, if you ask, “Who is winning the New Hampshire primaries?,” Siri will present an up-to-date list of results. You can also ask details on when a specific state’s primary is, or who won a past primary. For instance, asking “Who won the democratic Iowa caucus?” presents a full list of delegate information.

            The live results surfaced via Siri come from the Associated Press, Apple says. Apple News will also tap into AP real-time results for its county-by-county results throughout the election season.
            
            Just like for other queries, if you ask Siri something about the election that it does not know the answer to, it will default to web results. The upgraded election-specific Siri queries are rolling out today, so you can give them a try now, but it might take a few days before everything is fully rolled out.
